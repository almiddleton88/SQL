-- For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
-- Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
-- Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

--Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

-- Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 
SELECT * FROM Spotifydata
LIMIT 20;

SELECT COUNT(id)
FROM "Spotifydata";

--1. What is the average danceability of Olivia Rodrigo's songs? 
SELECT artist_name
,avg(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
WHERE artist_name = 'Olivia Rodrigo';

--2. Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity? 
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

--3. What artist released the longest song? 
SELECT artist_name, track_name, duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms desc
LIMIT 1;

--4. What's the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs?
SELECT AVG(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
WHERE popularity >=92;

-- 5.How many songs does each artist have in the database? 
SELECT artist_name, COUNT(track_name) AS number_of_songs 
FROM "Spotifydata"
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY number_of_songs DESC;

-- 6. Doja Cat and Bad Bunny both have 3 songs in this database. Which of them has a greater average in energy?

SELECT id, artist_name, COUNT(track_name) AS number_of_songs, AVG (energy) AS avg_energy
FROM "Spotifydata"
WHERE artist_name = 'Doja Cat'
OR artist_name = 'Bad Bunny'
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY avg_energy DESC;
